### About GGUF

GGUF is a new format introduced by the llama.cpp team on August 21st 2023. It is a replacement for GGML, which is no longer supported by llama.cpp.

Here is an incomplete list of clients and libraries that are known to support GGUF:

* [llama.cpp](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp). The source project for GGUF. Offers a CLI and a server option.
* [text-generation-webui](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui), the most widely used web UI, with many features and powerful extensions. Supports GPU acceleration.
* [KoboldCpp](https://github.com/LostRuins/koboldcpp), a fully featured web UI, with GPU accel across all platforms and GPU architectures. Especially good for story telling.
* [GPT4All](https://gpt4all.io/index.html), a free and open source local running GUI, supporting Windows, Linux and macOS with full GPU accel.
* [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), an easy-to-use and powerful local GUI for Windows and macOS (Silicon), with GPU acceleration. Linux available, in beta as of 27/11/2023.
* [LoLLMS Web UI](https://github.com/ParisNeo/lollms-webui), a great web UI with many interesting and unique features, including a full model library for easy model selection.
* [Faraday.dev](https://faraday.dev/), an attractive and easy to use character-based chat GUI for Windows and macOS (both Silicon and Intel), with GPU acceleration.
* [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python), a Python library with GPU accel, LangChain support, and OpenAI-compatible API server.
* [candle](https://github.com/huggingface/candle), a Rust ML framework with a focus on performance, including GPU support, and ease of use.
* [ctransformers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers), a Python library with GPU accel, LangChain support, and OpenAI-compatible AI server. Note, as of time of writing (November 27th 2023), ctransformers has not been updated in a long time and does not support many recent models.

## Compatibility

These quantised GGUFv2 files are compatible with llama.cpp from August 27th onwards, as of commit [d0cee0d](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/commit/d0cee0d36d5be95a0d9088b674dbb27354107221)

They are also compatible with many third party UIs and libraries - please see the list at the top of this README.

## Explanation of quantisation methods

<details>
  <summary>Click to see details</summary>

The new methods available are:

* GGML_TYPE_Q2_K - "type-1" 2-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weight. Block scales and mins are quantized with 4 bits. This ends up effectively using 2.5625 bits per weight (bpw)
* GGML_TYPE_Q3_K - "type-0" 3-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 6 bits. This end up using 3.4375 bpw.
* GGML_TYPE_Q4_K - "type-1" 4-bit quantization in super-blocks containing 8 blocks, each block having 32 weights. Scales and mins are quantized with 6 bits. This ends up using 4.5 bpw.
* GGML_TYPE_Q5_K - "type-1" 5-bit quantization. Same super-block structure as GGML_TYPE_Q4_K resulting in 5.5 bpw
* GGML_TYPE_Q6_K - "type-0" 6-bit quantization. Super-blocks with 16 blocks, each block having 16 weights. Scales are quantized with 8 bits. This ends up using 6.5625 bpw

## How to download GGUF files

**Note for manual downloaders:** You almost never want to clone the entire repo! Multiple different quantisation formats are provided, and most users only want to pick and download a single file.

The following clients/libraries will automatically download models for you, providing a list of available models to choose from:

* LM Studio
* LoLLMS Web UI
* Faraday.dev

### In `text-generation-webui`

Under Download Model, you can enter the model repo: TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF and below it, a specific filename to download, such as: mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf.

Then click Download.

### On the command line, including multiple files at once

I recommend using the `huggingface-hub` Python library:

```shell
pip3 install huggingface-hub
```

Then you can download any individual model file to the current directory, at high speed, with a command like this:

```shell
huggingface-cli download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

<details>
  <summary>More advanced huggingface-cli download usage (click to read)</summary>

You can also download multiple files at once with a pattern:

```shell
huggingface-cli download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False --include='*Q4_K*gguf'
```

For more documentation on downloading with `huggingface-cli`, please see: [HF -> Hub Python Library -> Download files -> Download from the CLI](https://huggingface.co/docs/huggingface_hub/guides/download#download-from-the-cli).

To accelerate downloads on fast connections (1Gbit/s or higher), install `hf_transfer`:

```shell
pip3 install hf_transfer
```

And set environment variable `HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER` to `1`:

```shell
HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1 huggingface-cli download TheBloke/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2-GGUF mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf --local-dir . --local-dir-use-symlinks False
```

Windows Command Line users: You can set the environment variable by running `set HF_HUB_ENABLE_HF_TRANSFER=1` before the download command.

<!-- README_GGUF.md-how-to-run start -->
## Example `llama.cpp` command

Make sure you are using `llama.cpp` from commit [d0cee0d](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/commit/d0cee0d36d5be95a0d9088b674dbb27354107221) or later.

```shell
./main -ngl 35 -m mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf --color -c 32768 --temp 0.7 --repeat_penalty 1.1 -n -1 -p "<s>[INST] {prompt} [/INST]"
```

Change `-ngl 32` to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Remove it if you don't have GPU acceleration.

Change `-c 32768` to the desired sequence length. For extended sequence models - eg 8K, 16K, 32K - the necessary RoPE scaling parameters are read from the GGUF file and set by llama.cpp automatically. Note that longer sequence lengths require much more resources, so you may need to reduce this value.

If you want to have a chat-style conversation, replace the `-p <PROMPT>` argument with `-i -ins`

For other parameters and how to use them, please refer to [the llama.cpp documentation](https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/blob/master/examples/main/README.md)

## How to run in `text-generation-webui`

Further instructions can be found in the text-generation-webui documentation, here: [text-generation-webui/docs/04 ‐ Model Tab.md](https://github.com/oobabooga/text-generation-webui/blob/main/docs/04%20%E2%80%90%20Model%20Tab.md#llamacpp).

## How to run from Python code

You can use GGUF models from Python using the [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python) or [ctransformers](https://github.com/marella/ctransformers) libraries. Note that at the time of writing (Nov 27th 2023), ctransformers has not been updated for some time and is not compatible with some recent models. Therefore I recommend you use llama-cpp-python.

### How to load this model in Python code, using llama-cpp-python

For full documentation, please see: [llama-cpp-python docs](https://abetlen.github.io/llama-cpp-python/).

#### First install the package

Run one of the following commands, according to your system:

```shell
# Base ctransformers with no GPU acceleration
pip install llama-cpp-python
# With NVidia CUDA acceleration
CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_CUBLAS=on" pip install llama-cpp-python
# Or with OpenBLAS acceleration
CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_BLAS=ON -DLLAMA_BLAS_VENDOR=OpenBLAS" pip install llama-cpp-python
# Or with CLBLast acceleration
CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_CLBLAST=on" pip install llama-cpp-python
# Or with AMD ROCm GPU acceleration (Linux only)
CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_HIPBLAS=on" pip install llama-cpp-python
# Or with Metal GPU acceleration for macOS systems only
CMAKE_ARGS="-DLLAMA_METAL=on" pip install llama-cpp-python

# In windows, to set the variables CMAKE_ARGS in PowerShell, follow this format; eg for NVidia CUDA:
$env:CMAKE_ARGS = "-DLLAMA_OPENBLAS=on"
pip install llama-cpp-python
```

#### Simple llama-cpp-python example code

```python
from llama_cpp import Llama

# Set gpu_layers to the number of layers to offload to GPU. Set to 0 if no GPU acceleration is available on your system.
llm = Llama(
  model_path="./mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf",  # Download the model file first
  n_ctx=32768,  # The max sequence length to use - note that longer sequence lengths require much more resources
  n_threads=8,            # The number of CPU threads to use, tailor to your system and the resulting performance
  n_gpu_layers=35         # The number of layers to offload to GPU, if you have GPU acceleration available
)

# Simple inference example
output = llm(
  "<s>[INST] {prompt} [/INST]", # Prompt
  max_tokens=512,  # Generate up to 512 tokens
  stop=["</s>"],   # Example stop token - not necessarily correct for this specific model! Please check before using.
  echo=True        # Whether to echo the prompt
)

# Chat Completion API

llm = Llama(model_path="./mistral-7b-instruct-v0.2.Q4_K_M.gguf", chat_format="llama-2")  # Set chat_format according to the model you are using
llm.create_chat_completion(
    messages = [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a story writing assistant."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Write a story about llamas."
        }
    ]
)
```

# Original model card: Mistral AI_'s Mistral 7B Instruct v0.2


# Model Card for Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2

The Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.2 Large Language Model (LLM) is an improved instruct fine-tuned version of [Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1](https://huggingface.co/mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1).

For full details of this model please read our [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06825) and [release blog post](https://mistral.ai/news/la-plateforme/).

## Instruction format

In order to leverage instruction fine-tuning, your prompt should be surrounded by `[INST]` and `[/INST]` tokens. The very first instruction should begin with a begin of sentence id. The next instructions should not. The assistant generation will be ended by the end-of-sentence token id.

E.g.
```
text = "<s>[INST] What is your favourite condiment? [/INST]"
"Well, I'm quite partial to a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice. It adds just the right amount of zesty flavour to whatever I'm cooking up in the kitchen!</s> "
"[INST] Do you have mayonnaise recipes? [/INST]"
```

This format is available as a [chat template](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/chat_templating) via the `apply_chat_template()` method:

```python
from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer

device = "cuda" # the device to load the model onto

model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1")
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1")

messages = [
    {"role": "user", "content": "What is your favourite condiment?"},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "Well, I'm quite partial to a good squeeze of fresh lemon juice. It adds just the right amount of zesty flavour to whatever I'm cooking up in the kitchen!"},
    {"role": "user", "content": "Do you have mayonnaise recipes?"}
]

encodeds = tokenizer.apply_chat_template(messages, return_tensors="pt")

model_inputs = encodeds.to(device)
model.to(device)

generated_ids = model.generate(model_inputs, max_new_tokens=1000, do_sample=True)
decoded = tokenizer.batch_decode(generated_ids)
print(decoded[0])
```

## Model Architecture
This instruction model is based on Mistral-7B-v0.1, a transformer model with the following architecture choices:
- Grouped-Query Attention
- Sliding-Window Attention
- Byte-fallback BPE tokenizer

## Troubleshooting
- If you see the following error:
```
Traceback (most recent call last):
File "", line 1, in
File "/transformers/models/auto/auto_factory.py", line 482, in from_pretrained
config, kwargs = AutoConfig.from_pretrained(
File "/transformers/models/auto/configuration_auto.py", line 1022, in from_pretrained
config_class = CONFIG_MAPPING[config_dict["model_type"]]
File "/transformers/models/auto/configuration_auto.py", line 723, in getitem
raise KeyError(key)
KeyError: 'mistral'
```

Installing transformers from source should solve the issue
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/transformers

This should not be required after transformers-v4.33.4.

## Limitations

The Mistral 7B Instruct model is a quick demonstration that the base model can be easily fine-tuned to achieve compelling performance.
It does not have any moderation mechanisms. We're looking forward to engaging with the community on ways to
make the model finely respect guardrails, allowing for deployment in environments requiring moderated outputs.
